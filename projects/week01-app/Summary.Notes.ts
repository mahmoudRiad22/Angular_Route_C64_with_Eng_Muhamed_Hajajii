? 1- Angular history:
      * simply we started with html, css, vanilla-js
      * in 2010: google produced "angular js" known as "angular-V01"
      * in 2012: cuz js is "loosely", Microsoft introduced the "typescript" as a way to add data types interface to js.
      * in 2014: google produced angular-V02 which combined [angular, typescript] the first stable angular version with typescript.
      * since 2014: google keeps updating angular with v03[never released],v04,v05,v06,v07,v08,v09,v09,v10,v11,v12,v13,v14,v15,v16
      * in v017: a big change happened where "syntax & bundler" was hugely improved and updated.
      * after that: for v18,v19,v20..normal improvement and updates except for v20 which will have big change still unknown but will be stable in v21.

? 2- added value:
    -easier development process:
        -- DOM injection: you can simply drop any property from TS file into the html file using {{}}.
        -- Validation: better validation and easier.
        -- Security: better XSS security and stuff like that.
        -- Component based architecture.
        -- SPA.

? 3- framework vs library:

? 4- install angular
